            My name is Arman Yaralian, and I am an aspiring software engineer based out of Bellingham Washington.
            I graduated from Western Washington University with a 3.29 GPA, and gained many useful techinical skills
            such as c, c++, java, python, DNS servers, android development (Kotlin), Cobal, relational algebra,
            algorithms,
            and much more.

                    During my time in college, I worked as a bartender and server at the Bellingham Olive Garden.
                    This experience allowed me to hone many of my core strengths, including communication, customer
                    service, adaptability, and organization. In this fast-paced environment, I developed exceptional
                    time management skills, as I consistently worked upwards of thirty hours a week while maintaining
                    a full course load. Balancing these responsibilities required a high level of efficiency and
                    dedication,
                    which has prepared me well for future challenges. Additionally, my role involved interacting with a
                    diverse
                    range of customers, further enhancing my ability to handle various situations with professionalism
                    and poise.

                    Woodworking has been a passionate hobby of mine since I was 13 years old. Over the years, I've
                    crafted a variety of
                    items, from coffee tables and desks to shelves and planters. There's something incredibly rewarding
                    about seeing a
                    blueprint come to life and transform into a functional and beautiful piece. Through this hobby, I
                    have developed a
                    keen attention to detail, ensuring every cut and joint is precise. Patience has also been a crucial
                    skill I've honed,
                    as woodworking often requires careful planning and time-consuming effort. Additionally, creativity
                    has played a significant
                    role, pushing me to design unique and innovative pieces. These skills have seamlessly translated
                    into my coding projects,
                    leading to more precise, well-thought-out, and innovative solutions. Overall, woodworking has
                    enriched both my personal and
                    professional life, enhancing my ability to produce high-quality work.

                    As any true software engineer might be, I am an avid gamer. Growing up on Halo 2 and 3 on legendary
                    mode and participating in our weekly Super Smash Brothers tournaments, video games have become an
                    integral part of who I am today. Recently, my game of choice has been Helldivers 2 and
                    Counter-Strike, although some of my all-time favorites include Factorio (which I highly recommend if
                    you haven't heard of it) and Doom 2016. Beyond being an excellent way to pass time, video games have
                    taught me numerous valuable skills. These include a deep level of communication, effective teamwork,
                    patience, and leadership. The immersive and challenging nature of gaming has not only been enjoyable
                    but has also enriched my personal and professional development.

                    For my Senior project, I collaborated with three students to develop custom software for automating
                    racquetball tournament management, including scheduling and scorekeeping. The project comprised four
                    parts: a backend Django server, a web scraper for tournament data, an Android app for referees, and
                    a scheduling app for managing tournaments. I was primarily responsible for the scheduling app, which
                    enabled users to log in, schedule matches, and edit tournament data. Additionally, I managed client
                    relations, conducted weekly meetings, and ensured we met our goals and delivered a product our
                    client loved.
